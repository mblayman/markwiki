Boom! Here's Some Help
======================

### How Do I Work This Crazy Thing?

In order to work with MarkWiki, you need to learn some Markdown. You can either
jump right into editing and learn as you go (because Markdown is super easy),
or head over to the [[MarkWiki/Syntax]] page to learn more details.

### I'm An Admin Who's Been Told To Set Up MarkWiki

Okay, so maybe you don't actually have an interest in using MarkWiki (that's
too bad!), but you need to set it up. In that case, look at the
[[MarkWiki/Deployment]] page.

### What Else Can We Talk About?

We can talk about more questions, of course! The frequently asked ones, in fact.
Check them out at [[MarkWiki/FAQ]].

Also, if the main page of your wiki has been changed, find the original at
[[MarkWiki/Introduction]].
